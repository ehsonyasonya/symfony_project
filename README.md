### **Key Features**  

âœ… **User Roles & Authentication**  
- Uses JWT tokens for authentication.  
- **Admins manage users, employees, and services** and are the only ones allowed to create appointments.  
- Clients can view their scheduled appointments but cannot create them.  

âœ… **Appointment Booking & Management**  
- **Only admins can create appointments** for clients with employees.  
- Employees have individual schedules to prevent double bookings.  
- Prevents booking an employee at the same time slot twice.  

âœ… **Entity Relationships**  
- **Users** (Clients & Admins)  
- **Employees** (Linked to users)  
- **Appointments** (Connects clients, employees, and services)  
- **Services** (Bookable services)  
- **Schedule** (Manages employees' working hours)  

âœ… **Custom Error Handling & Validation**  
- Ensures valid user input and prevents scheduling conflicts.  
- Returns appropriate error messages for missing or invalid data.  

âœ… **Token-Based Authorization (JWT)**  
- **Admins must authenticate using a JWT token** to create appointments.  
- Protects endpoints from unauthorized access. 

### **Console Commands**  

The system provides two Symfony console commands for quick management:
##### **1. Add a New User** and **2. Add a New Service**

### **Postman Collection**  
A **Postman collection** with pre-configured requests for testing the API is available in the project folder:  
ðŸ“‚ **symfony_project.postman_collection.json** 

***Next Steps for Development***
- Improve unit tests for core functionalities.
- Enhance error handling and response messages.
- Implement a frontend for easier interaction.
